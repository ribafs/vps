Applications

An application is your website/webapp consisting of files that will be used for functionality and display purposes.
With Cipi, every Application is separated from each other because each app contains its own settings, database, permissions and PHP-FPM pool. This method allows to each user to be secure and protected in its own right. If one of your websites is compromised, the others would be completely safe.

    Application (main) Domain
    Application Server
    Application User
    Application (document root) Path
    Application PHP Version
    Application Aliases Number
    Application Action (Domain SSL and Destroy Application)
