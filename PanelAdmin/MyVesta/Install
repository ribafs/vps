Somente Debian é suportado

Debian 10 (recomendado, mas suporta versões anteriores), servidor limpo, recem instalado
Nginx
Várias versões do PHP
Envio de e-mail, podendo limitar quantos/hora. Podemos ver o script que envia, quando e para quem
Podemos bloquear completamenteo o myvestacp de forma que seja acessado somente com a secret URL. Exemplo: http://debian-10:8083/?zmxnmyvpan
Caso não tenha definido uma URL segura na instalção pode criar assim:
echo "<?php \$login_url='MY-SECRET-URL';" > /usr/local/vesta/web/inc/login_url.php
Funções perigosas do php foram desabilitadas

Auto-generating LetsEncrypt SSL for server hostname (signed SSL for Vesta 8083 port, for dovecot (IMAP & POP3) and for Exim (SMTP))

You can change Vesta port during installation or later using one command line: v-change-vesta-port [number]

ClamAV is configured to block zip/rar/7z archives that contains executable files (just like GMail)

Backup will run with lowest priority (to avoid load on server), and can be configured to run only by night (and to stop on the morning and continue next night)

You can compile Vesta binaries by yourself - src/deb/vesta_compile.sh

    You can even create your own APT repository in a minute
    We are using latest nginx version for vesta-nginx package
    With your own APT infrastructure you can take security of Vesta-installer infrastructure in your own hands. You will have full control of your Vesta code (this way you can rest assured that there's 0% chance that you'll install malicious packages from repositories that may get hacked)
    Binaries that you compile are 100% compatible with official VestaCP from vestacp.com, so you can run official VestaCP code with your own binaries (in case you don't want the source code from this fork)
