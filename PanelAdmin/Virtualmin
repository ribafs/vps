The truth is, Virtualmin is a supercharged version of Webminâ€”which is also on this list. Its source is open and widely used all over the world, with thousands of downloads and active users. Written in PHP, it perfectly supports UNIX operating systems, Linux distributions, and BSD extensions.

Moreover, Virtualmin is available in three product versions: Virtualmin GPL, Virtualmin Professional, and Cloudmin Professional. As expected, the first is free and open source while the last two are commercial. Regardless of which you use, Virtualmin is perfect for domain hosting and virtual servers like OpenVZ and KEN.

To reiterate, this is closest you can get in comparison with cPanel and Plesk.
