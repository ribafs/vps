Sending SMS using gnokii

In this tutorial we are using gnokii to send SMS
Prerequisites

This doc is documented and tested based on Alpine Linux 2.7, but it might work for earlier versions too.
You will also need some sort of modem that can send SMS (e.g. a USB dongle with a SIM-card).
Install

    Install required package(s)

apk add gnokii

    Create missing folders

mkdir -p /root/.cache/gnokii/

    Physically attach a SMS capable modem to the host

Configure

    Add the following content to '/etc/gnokiirc'

[global]
port = /dev/ttyUSB0
model = AT
connection = serial
use_locking = yes
serial_baudrate = 115200
smsc_timeout = 30

[gnokiid]
binddir = /usr/bin/

[logging]
debug = off
rlpdebug = off
xdebug = off

Note: You will most likely need to change the above config so it to suit your equipment and setup.

    Verify if the configuration works as expected

gnokii --identify
Note: You should receive a output that looks something like this:

GNOKII Version 0.6.31
Cannot open logfile /root/.cache/gnokii/gnokii-errors
WARNING: cannot open logfile, logs will be directed to stderr
IMEI         : 123456789012345

Sending SMS

    Now send a SMS

echo "Test sms" | gnokii --sendsms 123456
Note: You will need to replace 123456 with the phone number you want to send your test SMS
