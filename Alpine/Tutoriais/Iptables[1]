Activating Changes and Testing Connectivity

Changes made to /etc/network/interfaces can be activated by running:

/etc/init.d/networking restart

If you did not get any errors, you can now test that networking is configured properly by attempting to ping out:

ping www.google.com

apk add iputils

apk add iproute2

This provides the 'ss' command which is IMHO a 'better' version of netstat.

Show listening tcp ports:

ss -tl

Show listening tcp ports and associated processes:

ss -ptl

Show listening and established tcp connections:

ss -ta

Show socket usage summary:

ss -s

Show more options:

ss -h

drill

You may also wish to install 'drill' (it will also install the 'ldns' package) which is a superior (IMHO) replacement for nslookup and dig etc:

apk add drill

Then use it as you would for dig:

drill alpinelinux.org @8.8.8.8

To perform a reverse lookup (get a name from an IP) use the following syntax:

drill -x 8.8.8.8 @208.67.222.222
