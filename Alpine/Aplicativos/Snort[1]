This guide will set up (list subject to change):

    Snort
    Barnyard (maybe)
    BASE

This guide will assume:

    You have a knowledge of your network setup (at least know which subnets exist).
    You have Alpine 2.0.2 installed and working with networking setup.
    You have had at least three cups of coffee this morning. And not decaf.

Get Development Packages

Install Alpine and Pre-packaged components

apk add alpine-sdk mysql-dev php-mysql lighttpd php-xml php-pear libpcap-dev php-gd pcre-dev wireshark tcpdump tcpflow cvs bison flex
Download Non-Packaged Applications

Download the following packages

For the purpose of this document we will assume you download these files to /usr/src.

    Download snort from www.snort.org. We used version 2.8.6.1 in this document.
    Download the snort rules from http://www.snort.org/snort-rules/
    Download BASE from http://sourceforge.net/projects/secureideas/files/BASE/base-1.4.5/base-1.4.5.tar.gz/download
    Download adodb5 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/adodb/files/adodb-php5-only/adodb-511-for-php5/adodb511.zip/download

Compile Snort

Uncompress snort with something like:

tar -zxvf snort-2.8.6.1.tar.gz

Then do the following:

cd snort-2.8.6.1
./configure -enable-dynamicplugin --with-mysql
make
make install
Configure Snort and Ruleset

mkdir /etc/snort
cd /etc/snort
cp /usr/src/snort-2.8.6.1/etc/* .
mv /usr/src/snortrules-snapshot-2861.tar.gz /etc/snort/.
tar -zxvf /usr/src/snortrules-snapshot-2861.tar.gz

Now edit the snort.conf file:

vi snort.conf

and change the following:

    Change "var HOME_NET any" to "var HOME_NET X.X.X.X/X" (fill in the subnet with your trusted network)
    Change "var EXTERNAL_NET any" to "var EXTERNAL_NET !$HOME_NET" (this is stating everything except HOME_NET is external)
    Change "var RULE_PATH ../rules" to "var RULE_PATH /etc/snort/rules"
    Change "var SO_RULE_PATH ../so_rules" to "var SO_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/so_rules"
    Change "var PREPROC_RULE_PATH ../preproc_rules" to "var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /etc/snort/preproc_rules"
    Comment out the line that says "dynamicdetection directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules" (by placing a "#" in front of the line)
    Scroll down the list to the section with "# output database: log, ..." and remove the "#" from in front of this line.
    Edit this line to look like this:

    output database: log, mysql, user=root password=yoursecretpassword dbname=snort host=localhost

    Make note of the username, password, and dbname. You will need this information when we set up mysql.
    Find this line (line 194 in current version)

        preprocessor http_inspect: global iis_unicode_map unicode.map 1252 compress_depth 20480 decompress_depth 20480

    and remove from "compress_depth" to the end of the line. When done, the line will read:

        preprocessor http_inspect: global iis_unicode_map unicode.map 1252

    Find this line (line 207 in current version)

        inspect_gzip \

    and remove it.

    Save and quit.

Start and Setup MySQL

(Need to add detail here on starting up MySQL for the first time)

/usr/bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql
rc-update add mysql
/etc/init.d/mysql start
/usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'password'  (set password to the same password you specified in the snort.conf file)
mysql -u root -p

Once in mysql, type the following commands:

mysql> create database snort;
mysql> exit

Now create the database schema:

mysql -D snort -u root -p < /usr/src/snort-2.8.6.1/schemas/create_mysql
Configure PHP and PEAR

Edit /etc/php/php.ini and add the following under "Dynamic Extensions".

extension=mysql.so
extension=gd.so

Save and exit. From the command line, type the following:

pear install Image_Color
pear install Image_Canvas-alpha
pear install Image_Graph-alpha
pear install mail
pear install mail_mime
Start Apache or lighttpd

Need to decide which of these to use in production.
Setup BASE

^

mv /usr/src/adodb5 /var/www/localhost/htdocs/.
mv /usr/src/base-1.4.5/* /var/www/localhost/htdocs/.

Now, open your web browser and navigate to http://X.X.X.X/setup (where x.x.x.x is your server's IP address)

    Click continue on the first page.
    Step 1 of 5: Enter the path to ADODB.

        This is /var/www/localhost/htdocs/adodb5.

    Step 2 of 5:

        Database type = MySQL, Database name = snort, Database Host = localhost, Database username = root, Database Password = YOUR_PASSWORD

    Step 3 of 5: If you want to use authentication enter a username and password here.
    Step 4 of 5: Click on Create BASE AG.
    Step 5 of 5: one step 4 is done at the bottom click on Now continue to step 5.
    Copy the text on the screen, and then paste into a new file named /var/www/localhost/htdocs/base_conf.php. Save that file.

Configure Barnyard

To improve performance.
