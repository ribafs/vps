API Creation

In addition to creating a Droplet from the CyberPanel 1-Click App via the control panel, you can also use the DigitalOcean API
.

As an example, to create a 4GB CyberPanel Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following curl command. Youâ€™ll need to either save your API access token
to an environment variable or substitute it into the command below.

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
    '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"litespeedtechnol-cyberpanel-20-04"}' \
    "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
