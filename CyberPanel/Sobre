API Creation

In addition to creating a Droplet from the CyberPanel 1-Click App via the control panel, you can also use the DigitalOcean API
.

As an example, to create a 4GB CyberPanel Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following curl command. You’ll need to either save your API access token
to an environment variable or substitute it into the command below.

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
    '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"litespeedtechnol-cyberpanel-20-04"}' \
    "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"

O CyberPnel funciona servido sites/aplicativos para clientes.
No caso precisamos criar um servidor parrudo, instalar o CyberPanel nele e alí criar vários usuários com dominios e seus sites e emails.
