Como usar os 100 $ nos dois meses?

- Criar um projeto, para dentro dele adicionas as VMs
- Selecione uma droplet/vm adequada
    Em distributions selecionaria Ubuntu 20.04
    - Mas em Marketplace seleciono LAMP on Ubuntu 20.04
    - Plano
    Aceitar a sugestão default do DO: 
    Básico
        - 8 GB de RAM   
        - 4 vCPU
        - 160 GB disco SSD
        - 5 TB transferência
        - 40 $/mês
    - Aceito o datacenter de Frankfurt
    - Authentication
        SSH Keys
    - Choose a hostname. Quando adicionamos um domínio no DNS do DO, é bom usar o domínio no hostname. Podemos mudar depois
    - Add backup. Tá bom, aqui são mais 8$, então resta apenas 2 no mês.

LAMP 20.04

In less than a minute, spin up a cloud server with Apache, MySQL, and PHP installed.

- Apache 2.4.41
- MySQL server 8.0.21
- PHP 7.4
- Fail2ban 0.11.1
- Postfix 3.4.10
- Certbot 0.39.0

Getting started after deploying LAMP

In addition to the package installation, the One-Click also:

    Enables the UFW firewall to allow only SSH (port 22, rate limited), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) access.
    Sets the MySQL root password and runs mysql_secure_installation.
    Sets up the debian-sys-maint user in MySQL so the system’s init scripts for MySQL will work without requiring the MySQL root user password.

After you create a LAMP One-Click Droplet:

    You can view the LAMP instance immediately by visiting the Droplet’s IP address in your browser.
    You can log into the Droplet as root using either the password emailed to you or with an SSH key, if you added one during creation.
    The MySQL root password is in /root/.digitalocean_password.
    The web root is /var/www/html.
    You can get information about the PHP installation by logging into the Droplet and running php -i.

In addition, there are a few customized setup steps that we recommend you take.

Creating an Apache virtual hosts file for each site maintains the default configuration as the fallback, as intended, and makes it easier to manage changes when hosting multiple sites.

To do so, you’ll need to create two things for each domain: a new directory in /var/www for that domain’s content, and a new virtual host file in /etc/apache2/sites-available for that domain’s configuration. For a detailed walkthrough, you can follow How to Set Up Apache Virtual Hosts.

Setting up an SSL certificate enables HTTPS on the web server, which secures the traffic between the server and the clients connecting to it. Certbot is a free and automated way to set up SSL certificates on a server. It’s included as part of the LAMP One-Click to make securing the Droplet easier.

To use Certbot, you’ll need a registered domain name and two DNS records:

    An A record from a domain (e.g., example.com) to the server’s IP address
    An A record from a domain prefaced with www (e.g., www.example.com) to the server’s IP address

Additionally, if you’re using a virtual hosts file, you’ll need to make sure the server name directive in the VirtualHost block (e.g., ServerName example.com) is correctly set to the domain.

Once the DNS records and, optionally, the virtual hosts files are set up, you can generate the SSL certificate. Make sure to substitute the domain in the command.

certbot --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com

HTTPS traffic on port 443 is already allowed through the firewall. After you set up HTTPS, you can optionally deny HTTP traffic on port 80:

ufw delete allow 80/tcp

For a more detailed walkthrough, you can follow How to Secure Apache with Let’s Encrypt or view Certbot’s official documentation.

You can serve files from the web server by adding them to the web root (/var/www/html) using SFTP or other tools.

A newly-created LAMP Droplet includes an index.html web page. You can change this by uploading a custom index.html file or remove it.

API Creation

In addition to creating a Droplet from the LAMP 1-Click App via the control panel, you can also use the DigitalOcean API
.

As an example, to create a 4GB LAMP Droplet in the SFO2 region, you can use the following curl command. You’ll need to either save your API access token
to an environment variable or substitute it into the command below.

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$TOKEN'' -d \
    '{"name":"choose_a_name","region":"sfo2","size":"s-2vcpu-4gb","image":"lamp-20-04"}' \
    "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/droplets"
