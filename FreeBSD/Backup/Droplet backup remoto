I've just used a modified version on a virtual Linux Mint box to clone a physical hard drive on an aging RedHat server.

I ran the following as root on the virtual box:

ssh root@192.168.1.5 "dd if=/dev/cciss/c0d0" | dd of=/dev/sdb

    192.168.1.5 is the physical Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 box.
    /dev/sdb is a new virtual disk, which when finished cloning will be the basis of a virtual version of the old dying physical box.

How to migrate a droplet from Digital Ocean and mount it on an existing Fuga instance

Unfortunately Digital Ocean does not provide a way to directly export a droplet.
In this tutorial we will explain how to export a Digital Ocean Droplet and mount it on an existing Fuga instance.
Follow this tutorial if you would like to boot the Droplet to a new Fuga instance.

The tutorial below is derived from this PDF.
Requirements:

    Root access to the Digital Ocean Droplet.
    Password for Root on the Digital Ocean Droplet.
    Destination Storage Location with SSH access enabled.
    Destination Storage Location with 'qemu-utils' installed.

Procedure:

    Log into the Digital Ocean Droplet to prepare the Droplet for Backup.
        Reset root's password if you do not already know it.
    Use DD to zero out any deleted data on the partition, so that compression size of the backup is smaller.

    dd if=/dev/zero of=0bits bs=20M; rm 0bits

    Use DD to byte copy the Digital Ocean partition, feeding it into gzip, and then transfer it over SSH to the Storage Location.

    dd if=/dev/vda1 | gzip -1 - | ssh <user>@<storage_host> dd of=/storage/location/snapshot.image.gz

    Extract the gzipped image.

    gunzip /storage/location/snapshot.image.gz

    At this point you can manually mount the dd image file with the following commands:

    losetup /dev/loop1 /storage/location/snapshot.image
    mkdir snapshot
    mount /dev/loop1 snapshot
