Description    :
PHP, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" is a widely-used Open
Source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for
Web development and can be embedded into HTML.  Its syntax draws upon C,
Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn.  The main goal of the language is to
allow web developers to write dynamically generated webpages quickly, but
you can do much more with PHP.

Similarly;

php -v

PHP 7.4.0 (cli) (built: Nov 30 2019 01:12:56) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies

If you have web server installed, you can similarly verify PHP 7.4 installation by creating a PHP test file as shown below.

For example, if you have Apache installed, simply create a PHP 7.4 test file on the document root folder as follows.

echo '<?php phpinfo(); ?>' > /usr/local/www/apache24/data/info.php

Note that Apache can only process PHP files. Hence, ensure that you have mod_php modules installed.

pkg install mod_php74

Next, you need to tell Apache to process PHP files by creating a php.conf configuration file under /usr/local/etc/apache24/Includes/ with the following contents;

vim /usr/local/etc/apache24/Includes/php.conf

<IfModule dir_module>
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.html
    <FilesMatch "\.php$">
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    </FilesMatch>
    <FilesMatch "\.phps$">
        SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>

Save the file and restart Apache for the changes to take effect.

service apache24 restart

On the browser, enter the address, http://server_IP_address/info.php to verify PHP installation.
